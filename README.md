# DebageGPT - Autonomous AI Debate Opponent

## Introduction

This project presents an autonomous AI agent designed to engage in debates by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and speech recognition/synthesis technologies. The agent is capable of understanding and responding to debates in a structured manner, providing support in various stages of a debate, from introduction to conclusion. It is an innovative tool that can significantly enhance the quality of debates by offering strategic arguments, counterarguments, and rebuttals, all generated by an AI with a focus on logical consistency and persuasive power.

## Use Case and Usefulness

The primary use case for this project is to serve as a debating assistant for individuals or teams participating in debates, particularly in educational or public speaking contexts. It can be particularly useful in scenarios where participants are looking to strengthen their arguments through logical reasoning and evidence-based counterarguments. By leveraging AI, this tool ensures that debaters can present their arguments more effectively, by providing them with well-structured responses that are both logically sound and persuasive.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to convert spoken language into text, enabling real-time interaction in debates.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Employs `pyttsx3` for converting text responses into spoken words, facilitating auditory engagement in the debate.
- **Debate Structure**: Follows a predefined structure for debates, including introduction, presentation of arguments, counter-arguments, rebuttals, summarization, and conclusion.
- **AI-Generated Responses**: Leverages the power of LLMs to generate responses that are contextually relevant, logically sound, and persuasive.
- **Stage Detection**: Capable of determining the current stage of a debate and suggesting appropriate responses or actions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to:

1. Install the required libraries (`speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `whisper`, `requests`, and `json`).
2. Obtain an API key for the Perplexity AI service to access the LLM.
4. Set up the environment variables for the Perplexity API key.
5. Determine debate_topic and debater_viewpoint.
6. Run the `debategpt.py` and debate against LLM!

## Example Usage

```python
debate_topic = "Should men be drafted to the army forcefully or not"
debater_viewpoint = "Draft to army should be forced, because countries need to protect their borders by ensuring their safety and because there is no other way to fight in wars in case a country is attacked."

debate(debate_topic, debater_viewpoint, with_sound=True)
```

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the functionality, improve the debate structure, or integrate additional AI models are welcome. Please follow the standard GitHub workflow: fork, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
